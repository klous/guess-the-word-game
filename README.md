# Guess the word game
A word game where you guess the secret word by guessing letters with a limited number of guesses.

Each time you guess a wrong letter, you lose a guess until you have none remaining.

Played in the console, the game looks like this:

```
********* Number of Wrong Guesses left: 7  *********

********* Letters Guessed *********


_ o _ _ _ _ _ _ o _
What letter do you guess?

```
